## Image Classifier Web App with Flask
### Overview


This web application allows users to upload images and get predictions about the contents of the image using an image classifier model. The backend of the application uses Flask for creating a web server and integrates with a pre-trained machine learning model for image classification.

## Requirements
- Python (3.7+)
- Flask
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the model)
- Pillow (for image processing)
- Gunicorn (for deployment)
- Other required libraries: numpy, matplotlib, etc.

You can install the dependencies using pip:

'''pip install flask tensorflow pillow numpy matplotlib gunicorn'''
